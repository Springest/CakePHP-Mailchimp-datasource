# CakePHP Mailchimp Plugin Documentation

## Installation
* [Installation](Install.md)

## Documentation
This dev-branch version doesn't use a datasource anymore since that will have to change for 3.x soon anyway.
So it basically just uses Model methods as convenience wrappers.

### Mailchimp
That is the main library of this plugin, which allows to send batch emails and newsletters.
* [Mailchimp docs](Mailchimp.md)

### Mandrill
This is a subproduct of Mailchimp, allowing you to send personalized emails very fast and reliable.
* [Mandrill docs](Mandrill.md)
